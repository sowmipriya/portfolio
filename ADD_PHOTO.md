# How to Add Your Profile Photo

## Quick Steps

1. **Save your photo** to the `public` folder in this project
2. **Name it exactly**: `profile-photo.jpg`
3. **Recommended format**: 
   - Square image (1:1 aspect ratio)
   - At least 512x512 pixels
   - JPG, PNG, or WebP format
   - Good quality/clear image

## File Location

```
portfolio/
└── public/
    └── profile-photo.jpg  ← Place your photo here
```

## Supported Formats

- `.jpg` / `.jpeg` (recommended)
- `.png`
- `.webp`

## After Adding the Photo

1. The photo will automatically appear in the Hero section
2. If the photo doesn't load, a beautiful gradient placeholder with your initials "SR" will be shown
3. Refresh your browser if you're running the dev server

## Tips

- Use a square crop for best results (the photo displays in a circle)
- Make sure the file name is exactly `profile-photo.jpg` (case-sensitive)
- Keep file size reasonable (under 2MB recommended for fast loading)
